Biodiversity, at the basis of many essentials ecosystem services, is in the process of facing its sixth mass extinction. Although global extinction is unprecedented, there is so far no reason to expect that biodiversity dynamic at lower spatial and temporal scales follow this trend. Thus, links between
spatio-temporal scales and facets of biodiversity (\emph{i.e.} species richness, species diversity, colonization, extinction,
species turnover, etc) need to be fully understood if we want to address this worldwide crisis. So far,
attempts to describe biodiversity changes have been limited mainly by heterogeneity in spatial and
temporal scales that was hardly taken into account by the statistical modelling frameworks.

My PhD project propose to address this flaws in order to understand in more details biodiversity
changes across spatial and temporal scales. Especially, we aim at developing and testing nonparametric
tree-based modelling methods allowing to study the non-linear and interacting effects of
space and time-span on different aspects of biodiversity.

\underline{The specific objectives of my PhD project are:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Modelling and mapping avian species richness changes over Czech Republic across space and time
  scales.
\item
  Decompose the modelled biodiversity to colonization, extinction, species turnover, across spatiotemporal
  scales.
\item
  Estimate the strength of the link between environmental drivers of biodiversity change across
  spatio-temporal scales.
\item
  Apply the previously developed method to other European regions (e.g.~UK, Switzerland, France)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Human life quality is intrinsically linked to ecosystems state that he is living in. Indeed, ecosystems services extend in a large spectrum of mechanisms including nutrient cycle, food production, or climate and water cycle regulation \autocite{pereira_global_2012}. Some of those ecosystem
functions are managed by bird populations such as seed dispersal, controls pests or pollinate plant.
Unfortunately, anthropogenic stressors like habitat loss, over exploitation, pollution or introduction of
invasive species could lead biodiversity to its sixth mass extinction \autocite{barnosky_has_2011}.

While the loss of global biodiversity is unprecedented, current scientific literature has also shown that
temporal trends in local changes of biodiversity can be opposite to trends at larger scales \autocite{chase_species_2019}. Thus, current changes in biodiversity is far more complex than a simple global decrease:
most of the ecosystems undergo alterations of their communities with changes in species composition \autocite{blowes_geography_2019,dornelas_assemblage_2014}.

Typically, biodiversity is considered for a particular taxon (\emph{e.g.} birds, amphibians, reptiles\ldots), but also
according to the spatial scale it is defined by. Here, the term scale refers to the area in which the
biodiversity in considered, also referred hereafter as grain size. So far, it has been assumed that
holding the spatial scale constant when studying biodiversity is mandatory \autocite{whittaker_scale_2001}. As
a matter of fact, it is known that species richness increases with the area considered \autocite{arrhenius_species_1921} and this relationship is approximately linear on a log-log scale (Species-Area Relationship,
SAR). However, this assumption restricts the data accessibility as sampling plans widely differ
according to the species studied, the resources available or, the field conditions. Thus, developing a
method capable of dealing with biodiversity across varying grain size could increase significantly the
data availability. Moreover, it would allow to model biodiversity at different spatial scales than the
ones used in the data. Modelling biodiversity indexes at finer spatial grain size that the data used to
learn the model is referred as \emph{downscaling} biodiversity whilst extrapolating at coarser grain-size is
called \emph{upscaling}.

So far, there are indications that such method can be used. For instance, \textcite{keil_downscaling_2014} and \textcite{keil_downscaling_2013} showed promising downscaling biodiversity models using biodiversity data with different
spatial scales, whilst \textcite{kunin_upscaling_2018} showed that upscaling biodiversity is also possible. Thus, all
the constituents of cross-scales models are known but still need to be gathered and tested. For
instance, \textcite{jarzyna_spatial_2015} used a Bayesian framework to study temporal changes of avian
biodiversity (colonization, extinction, temporal turnover) across scales. However, other approaches
such as parametric Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and
Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) or non-parametric tree based machine learning methods
need to be tested.

\hypertarget{aims}{%
\chapter{Aims}\label{aims}}

The main aim of my PhD will be to test different statistical modeling methods allowing to integrate
cross-scales biodiversity data. This method will allow to model biodiversity facets at various spatial
and temporal grain sizes.

This principal objective can be divided into four sub-objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{I will model temporal dynamics of avian species richness in the Czech Republic across spatio-temporal scales} (\emph{i.e.} grain size ranging from less than 1 Km² to more than 2 000
  Km²). This will allow to map biodiversity over Czech republic at any desired spatial and
  temporal scales. Given the well known Species-Area Relationship \autocites[SAR,][]{arrhenius_species_1921,storch_untangling_2004} and Species-Time Relationship \autocite[STR,][]{white_comparison_2006} we expect to
  see higher species richness at coarser spatial and temporal scales than at finer scales.
  Moreover, we will be able to look at the effect of grain size over biodiversity trends. So far,
  \textcite{chase_species_2019} showed that North American avian biodiversity is largely stable at fine
  scales, but that it tends to increase with spatial scale. Thus, we can expect to observe the same
  trends for the Czech Republic.
\item
  \textbf{I will decompose the modelled biodiversity to colonization, extinction, and species turnover, across spatio-temporal scales.} Indeed, biodiversity dynamic is underlined by
  those ecological processes whose trends can be opposite to the species richness' one \autocite{dornelas_assemblage_2014}. Thus, understanding how they fluctuate according to the spatio-temporal scales
  they are considered will help understand the global biodiversity dynamic. So far, \textcite{jarzyna_spatial_2015} showed that those facets of biodiversity was in general declining with increasing
  spatial grain size for the state of New-York. However the colonization undergoes a slower
  steep. Thus, those trends are also expected to occur with our model for the Czech Republic.
\item
  \textbf{I will estimate the strength of the link between environmental drivers of biodiversity change across spatio-temporal scales.} So far, land use change, habitat loss, or changes in
  climatic conditions are good candidates for such drivers. \textcite{jarzyna_spatial_2015} showed that
  environmental parameters, such as climate change variables (\emph{e.g.} temperatures, pluviometry)
  and landscape variables (\emph{e.g.} elevation, sampling effort), were dependent on the spatial scale
  on the one hand, but also on the metric considered on the other hand (\emph{i.e.} colonization,
  extinction\ldots). Thus, the expectations are more difficult to assess here. What we know is that at
  larger scales (\emph{i.e.} biogeographic or continental), evolutionary processes tend to drive the
  biodiversity patterns \autocite{keil_downscaling_2014}. Climatic and land cover parameters, for their part,
  intervene at scales ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers. At even finer scales, biotic
  and population dynamics processes are driving.
\item
  \textbf{Once the methods will be validated for the Czech Republic, the logical continuation will be to use it over other European regions (\textit{i.e.} Switzerland, United-Kingdom, Brittany).} The main advantage of looking at other countries is to look at the trend of
  biodiversity facets at larger scales. As for objective 1, we can also expect that the species
  richness trends will tend to increase with spatial scale \autocite{chase_species_2019} whilst, as for
  objective 2, other biodiversity dynamic indexes will decrease \autocite{jarzyna_spatial_2015}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data}\label{data}}

A significant part of this project will consist in \textbf{1)} harvesting, gathering and managing biodiversity
datasets of the aimed taxon (i.e.~birds here) in order to \textbf{2)} use them to model biodiversity facets
across spatial and temporal scales.
