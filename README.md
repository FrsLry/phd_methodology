# PhD draft

This is the repository on which you will be able to see my current work. 

In order to make this project reproducible, I am using the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package that allows one to use the correct package versions that I used for my work. 

## How to use renv for this repo

* First clone this repository

* Once renv is installed in your library, use `renv::restore()` in the `phd.Rproj` environment


**Please note** that the preferred version is the HTML, on which you can make comments using [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/). Otherwise, you can create a branch or even make some comment in the file of your choice. The .pdf and .docx version are downloadable if necessary but don't represent the final layout yet.
